La Fabrica.... run by Grau's little horny hipster dude, this place has an interior which is sweating cool out of every orifice.

One time I was having dinner and I asked the waitress for a pint of beer and she said "we're in Spain, we don't drink pints here" which is a) a bit twatty and b) absolute bollocks because I reckon that you can drink pints in 75% of bars in Valencia. 

The food ain't bad. At the moment it's a cross between contemporary tapas (whatever that is) and Mexican style food. I recommend the puff pastry finger that has sobrasada and cheese inside. Fucking yum!

Not to be confused with La Fabrica de Hielo.
