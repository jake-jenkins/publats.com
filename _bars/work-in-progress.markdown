Opposite Cabañal Market this is a treat of a bar with a nice terrace and an eclectic crowd. 

Good prices (€1.50 a bottle of beer (Estrella Levante), €2 a tinto de verano, which maybe could have been better with a little vermouth added).

I have nothing silly or stupid to say about this place unfortunately but I will have a think and edit accordingly.
