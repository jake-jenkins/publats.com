<p>Probably my favourite bar and against which every other bar will be rated.</p>

<p>Cool inside – with a quirky interior.</p>

<p>Nice, little sun trapped terrace.</p>

<p>Very reasonably priced food and drink.</p>

<p>Ok…. the toilets are bit dodgy…. but most bar toilets in Spain are bit dodgy.</p>

<p>La Paca is also one of the few bars in Valencia that will give you a little tapa with every drink. Bonus points all round.</p>
