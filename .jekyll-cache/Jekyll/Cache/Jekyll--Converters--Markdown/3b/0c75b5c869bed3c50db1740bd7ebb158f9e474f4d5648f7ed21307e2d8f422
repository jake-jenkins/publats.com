<p>Calabuig is situated in a beautiful building at the end of the grand, noisy Port Avenue (Avenida del Puerto). It has a decent-sized terrace where you can relax and enjoy your food and drinks whilst 3 lanes of traffic roar behind you.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s inside, however, that makes this place special with its old dark wood furniture and traditional features itâ€™s quite atmospheric. You can imagine that it hasnâ€™t changed much in 60 years.</p>

<p>As for the food and drinksâ€¦. well Iâ€™d say that everything is a bit average quality-wiseâ€¦ classic Spanish grub (tapas, platos combinados)â€¦ reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Toilets not bad.</p>
