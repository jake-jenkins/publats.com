So this was the first and most vomit coloured bar on “La Ruta de Baka-Grau”.

I often walk past the unsigned Bar Pele and think “hmmm I don’t really fancy this bar/hmmm that bar looks shit/how does that bar survive? Etc” 

However, despite it’s vulgar lime green exterior it wasn’t too bad… we sat on the little terrace, sipped our quinto (little beer – priced €1.30 – a bit above average for this area) and nibbled on some excellent cacaos (mixed nut/snack things).

The moral of the story? Don’t judge a shitty looking bar by its vomit coloured walls. 

Is it worth going to? Maybe... but only if youˋre really thirsty.
