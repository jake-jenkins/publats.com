Calabuig is situated in a beautiful building at the end of the grand, noisy Port Avenue (Avenida del Puerto). It has a decent-sized terrace where you can relax and enjoy your food and drinks whilst 3 lanes of traffic roar behind you.

It’s inside, however, that makes this place special with its old dark wood furniture and traditional features it’s quite atmospheric. You can imagine that it hasn’t changed much in 60 years.

As for the food and drinks…. well I’d say that everything is a bit average quality-wise… classic Spanish grub (tapas, platos combinados)… reasonable prices.

Toilets not bad.
