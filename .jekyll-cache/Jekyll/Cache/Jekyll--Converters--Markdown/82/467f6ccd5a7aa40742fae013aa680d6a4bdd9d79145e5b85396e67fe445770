<p>Opposite Caba√±al Market this is a treat of a bar with a nice terrace and an eclectic crowd.</p>

<p>Good prices (‚Ç¨1.50 a bottle of beer (Estrella Levante), ‚Ç¨2 a tinto de verano, which maybe could have been better with a little vermouth added).</p>

<p>I have nothing silly or stupid to say about this place unfortunately but I will have a think and edit accordingly.</p>
