<p>When I was developing the idea of this Publats web page my friend Fernando, a fellow lover of ice-cold beer, was instantly inspired to get involved.</p>

<p>Therefore, he needed little convincing when I proposed the idea of La Ruta de Baka-Grau. The route is named after an infamous strip of 1980s/early 90s ecstasy-fuelled night clubs situated just outside Valencia (which every Valencian will happily tell you about with a mixture of embarrassment and pride) called: “La ruta de bakalou”.</p>

<p>There were no illegal drugs consumed on our route, just beer and bar snacks…. “booooorrrrring!” I here you say…. this is probably true but look, we’re in our mid-thirties and I had to be up early the next day to go to the beach so fuck off!</p>

<p>Anyway, one’s inferiority complex aside…..the only ‘rule’ we had was that we would drink quintos (little 200ml bottles of beer) where available so that we could fit in as many bars as possible into the route.</p>

<p>In the end we managed to go to 6 bars…. but we did have 2 drinks in one of them…..rock’n roll!!!</p>

<p>No hangover the next day though…. So in the end I had the last laugh…..losers!</p>
