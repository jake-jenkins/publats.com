I remember visiting FdH in the first week that it opened about four years ago and it literally was still an ice factory.

On that cold evening, at some point back in the last decade, it was pretty empty (of people and decor) and the 4 or so punters had to huddle around a portable gas heater to keep warm.

How times have changed. Not only is FdH almost always busy the owners have filled the space well with (amongst other things) palm trees and shipping containers (that serve as a bar and toilets).

Normally I would say that a place like this was so far up its own ass that it was poking out its left nostril (whilst continuing to go there for a beer at least once a week). However, FdH somehow (just about) doesn’t cross over the fine line of twattishness. Free gigs and events as well as reasonably priced drinks help in this regard.
