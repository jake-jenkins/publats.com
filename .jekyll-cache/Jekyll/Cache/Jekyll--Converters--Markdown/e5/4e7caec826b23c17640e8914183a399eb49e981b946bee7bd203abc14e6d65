<p>A typical Spanish bar, the best thing about El Kapricho is its terrace, which is located off the main avenue thus slightly quieter than many terraces in the area.</p>

<p>Oh, and their tinto de verano is excellent (better to ask for one without the added sugar though) and quite possibly the best in Grao.</p>

<p>Inside is hardly worth writing about… so I won’t.</p>

<p>It’s not a bar worth going out of your way for but if you’re close by and gagging for a cheeky drink it is worth it.</p>
