Stop number 4 on La Ruta de Baka-Grau and arguably the best bar of the evening was Mala Fama (which means bad reputation).

I could go down the cheesy road here and say that Mala fama has anything but a bad reputation but I won’t because I’m not a local newspaper journalist… or a twat.

Anyway…. this bar ticks all the boxes (maybe I am a twat):

Cool interior = tick
Tasty looking food = tick
Lively terrace = tick
Are you tired of reading bullet points = tick
The only negatives are that it’s a bit too cool, the gender names on the toilet doors are in Valencian…. which always confuses me. Oh and my mate has a problem with the sinks in the toilets being shaped like tin buckets.

Ultimately this is a great addition to the area. Go there!

Apologies for the shite photo... I aim to go back and retake it soon.
