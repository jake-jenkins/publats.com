This bar is owned by the same people who own the brilliant La Paca (and maybe some other places in the area)… 

La Peseta used to be my favourite bar in Valencia… but that all changed after the summer of 2017 when they had a re-fit and a change of direction in terms of what the bar is and the type of people it wants to attract. 

That said, it’s not a bad bar now the food is pretty good and interesting but it’s a little pretentious. The drinks are not too bad either but they have stopped selling Mahou in bottles for €1.50. Basically it’s gone a bit posh/fancy pancy. Shame.
