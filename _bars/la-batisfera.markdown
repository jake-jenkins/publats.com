So, this is the sister bar of the popular, but slightly up its own ring, Ubik Cafe in Russafa.

It’s half bookshop half bar. Now, I like reading and I like drinking but rarely at the same time. It must be said however, that this bookshop/bar combo thingy is quite novel….. ughhh sigh!

Anyway, despite the pretentious pricks sitting around the place sipping cafe con leche (with oat milk no doubt – I had regular cow milk in my coffee before you ask… and yes I’m probably considered a pretentious prick by some people too)…….. it’s a really nice place and a great addition to the area.

The beer price is slightly higher than average with it being 3 euros for a double, but it is Tyris so it’s not a big problem.

I need to go back to this place more and I’d recommend it if you are in the area. They have lots of events/gigs etc.
