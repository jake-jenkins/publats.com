<p>Plaza de la Cruzâ€¦ you cute beast. It wasnâ€™t always this way. The arrival of Mirant La Mar has changed the vibe of this place significantly. How did they do it? Simple. Every evening they string some lights around a tree and shazaammmm the plaza is transformed.</p>

<p>Good priced Mediterranean grub and reasonably priced beer. My Cabanal bar of 2020</p>
