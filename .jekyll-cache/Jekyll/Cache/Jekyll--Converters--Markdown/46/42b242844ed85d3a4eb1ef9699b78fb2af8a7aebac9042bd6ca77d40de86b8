<p>This bar is owned by the same people who own the brilliant La Paca (and maybe some other places in the area)â€¦</p>

<p>La Peseta used to be my favourite bar in Valenciaâ€¦ but that all changed after the summer of 2017 when they had a re-fit and a change of direction in terms of what the bar is and the type of people it wants to attract.</p>

<p>That said, itâ€™s not a bad bar now the food is pretty good and interesting but itâ€™s a little pretentious. The drinks are not too bad either but they have stopped selling Mahou in bottles for â‚¬1.50. Basically itâ€™s gone a bit posh/fancy pancy. Shame.</p>
