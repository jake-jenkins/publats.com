<p>Formally a creative community space, El Clavo looks like it has been situated on Grauâ€™s coolest street for years (I think it arrived in late 2017).</p>

<p>The food is pretty good (tapas etc) although I think the cheese and jamon plates are a little expensiveâ€¦. However, itâ€™s the snacks that really tickle my balls! Olives, monkey nuts and my favourite â€˜special nut mixâ€™ keep me going back for salty fun times.</p>

<p>Even though El Clavo doesnâ€™t have the best variety of beer it is still the best bar on the street if you just want to grab a cold drink, especially now that La peseta has gone all posh.</p>
