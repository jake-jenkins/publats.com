Plaza de la Cruz... you cute beast. It wasn't always this way. The arrival of Mirant La Mar has changed the vibe of this place significantly. How did they do it? Simple. Every evening they string some lights around a tree and shazaammmm the plaza is transformed. 

Good priced Mediterranean grub and reasonably priced beer. My Cabanal bar of 2020
