<p>It took me a while to try Cabañal’s Ca La Mar because I was under the impression that it was a fish restaurant…. well, there is a lot of fish on the menu (Yuk!) but also lots of other tasty non-fishy food (Yay!).</p>

<p>It’s a cute, little bar/restaurant on the corner of a small, cute, pedestrian street with a cute terrace and cute bar staff. The best thing, however, is one of their tapas offerings. If my memory serves me correctly the dish consists of some bite-sized pieces of chicken and cheese wrapped in bacon (possibly glazed in honey or maybe curry – I was a little drunk at the time)…. dribble dribble.</p>

<p>Reasonably priced, great quality and one of my favourite places to eat in the neighbourhood…. made me dribble.</p>
