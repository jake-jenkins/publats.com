Stop number 5 on La Ruta de Baka-Grau is called El Ultramarinos and is a relatively new bar in El Cabañal despite the fact that it looks old/traditional.

The food looked fish heavy (with a lot of tinned options… I’m not sure why anyone would go to a bar and pay a premium to eat tinned fish… but I’m Welsh so what do I know?) and quite expensive. The staff were friendly and attentive and the terrace (a new edition) was lively.

I think that this is more of a bar for eating than drinking and as we didn’t fancy eating tinned fish it’s difficult to give it an accurate review.
