I need a better camera!


Although this is a Shitty Spanish Bar Chinese Version 2.0 it is probably one of the best in the area.

Located on Port Avenue (Av. del Puerto) Luis was recently opened by this very friendly and smiley Chinese guy (possibly but probably not called Luis) who used to work as the chef in a different Shitty Spanish Bar Chinese Version 2.0 up the road.

Itâ€™s clean inside but lacks a terrace. The prices are reasonable but the best thing is the food, especially the bocadillos (stuffed baguettes). This guy makes a bad boy Chivito (the best type of bocadillo) with good quality ingredients.
