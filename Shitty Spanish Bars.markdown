Think plastic seats.

Think T.V. in the corner.

Think low prices.

Think grim toilets.

Think run by an (often) grumpy guy with a big belly and a moustache.

Along with banks and pharmacies these bars are everywhere in Valencia (there are less in the city centre). If itâ€™s not a Shitty Spanish Bar Chinese Version 2.0 then it will likely be a Shitty Spanish Bar.
