Wikipedia has this to say about Time: 

"Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future."

What is the time? Why are you wasting my time? Who has the time? What time did I actually reserve the table at Fumiferro for?

Important questions. The most difficult one for me to answer is the latter. On the phone I suggested 8pm. The guy on the end of the line preferred 10pm. I asked about 9pm and he liked the idea of 9.30/9.45pm. 

In the end, on arrival, the guy on the door informed us that the table was reserved for 8.30pm. 

Time issues aside (could have been my fault), the waiter was cool and found us a table (the best outcome given the confusion). 

I had originally booked a table outside in the large (potentially recently refurbished) terrace however due to the aforementioned confusion we discovered really smart, typically high ceilinged cabanal noshery. The food was meaty, as to be expected from a grill but they do have vegetarian options. Beer was a bit uninspired... some local beers would be an easy improvement. 

I highly recommend this place... but only if you have the (right) time.
