The place to go when La Pascuala is fully booked, Los Faroles specialises in large bocadillos (baguettes filled with meat & stuff).

Usually I order a half size bocadillo but when I last went, with my football mates, we all ordered full sized, mega-super, bad ass bocadillos…. never again! Ok, the quality is pretty good (La Pascuala is better) and the value for money is excellent but for me it’s too much food. I felt full all day… in fact I still feel full just thinking about it.

Unless you have a large apitite be careful what you ask for….Busy on weekends, but you can always takeaway and eat on the beach.
