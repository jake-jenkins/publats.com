Formally a creative community space, El Clavo looks like it has been situated on Grau's coolest street for years (I think it arrived in late 2017).

The food is pretty good (tapas etc) although I think the cheese and jamon plates are a little expensive…. However, it’s the snacks that really tickle my balls! Olives, monkey nuts and my favourite ‘special nut mix’ keep me going back for salty fun times.

Even though El Clavo doesn’t have the best variety of beer it is still the best bar on the street if you just want to grab a cold drink, especially now that La peseta has gone all posh.
