When I started my Valencian love affair, around 6 years ago, I went to a bar for a takeaway coffee and the waiter put the cup in a bag for me (presumably in order to take the coffee home).

I asked someone about this afterwards and they said that there wasnˋt really the culture of drinking coffee on the go in Valencia.

Anyway, times havenˋt really changed that much and it is still rare to see a Valencian walking around (or even sitting on a commuter train) drinking a hot drink.

With this in mind I was a little surprised to find that Tallat Coffee is more takeaway/store/workshop than cafe. Itˋs a nice spot run by friendly people (locals I think) and the coffee is good. I have the impression that it isnˋt really a sit-in place (I could be wrong) which is a shame because it would be great to have an area inside Tallat to chill and read etc.

Whilst sipping my cafe con leche (€1.90) I did a little Google investigation to find out more about Tallat and discovered that they run regular events where you can try different coffees called: Cupping Club.

Intrigued by the word cupping, I entered it into the wonderful Urban Dictionary and this is what it said:

Cupping = To weigh, with one’s hands, someones testicles: “I was feeling bad, until Brian gave me some cupping. I felt better afterwards.”

You decide whether to attend the next event or not!
