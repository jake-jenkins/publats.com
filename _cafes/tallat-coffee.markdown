<p>When I started my Valencian love affair, around 6 years ago, I went to a bar for a takeaway coffee and the waiter put the cup in a bag for me (presumably in order to take the coffee home). </p>

<p>I asked someone about this afterwards and they said that there wasnˋt really the culture of drinking coffee on the go in Valencia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, times havenˋt really changed that much and it is still rare to see a Valencian walking around (or even sitting on a commuter train) drinking a hot drink. </p>

<p>With this in mind I was a little surprised to find that Tallat Coffee is more takeaway/store/workshop than cafe. Itˋs a nice spot run by friendly people (locals I think) and the coffee is good. I have the impression that it isnˋt really a sit-in place (I could be wrong) which is a shame because it would be great to have an area inside Tallat to chill and read etc. </p>

<p>Whilst sipping my cafe con leche (€1.90) I did a little Google investigation to find out more about Tallat and discovered that they run regular events where you can try different coffees called: Cupping Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intrigued by the word cupping, I entered it into the wonderful Urban Dictionary and this is what it said:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cupping</strong> = To&nbsp;weigh, with one's hands,&nbsp;someones testicles: "I was&nbsp;feeling bad, until&nbsp;Brian&nbsp;gave me some cupping. I&nbsp;felt&nbsp;better afterwards."</p>

<p>You decide whether to attend the next event or not!</p>
