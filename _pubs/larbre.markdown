Sitting in the shadows of the popular and more established La Paca bar L’Arbre deserves more love and attention.

For starters it has a cool walled garden terrace, a rarity in these parts. Secondly, my mate Marc told me that the food is pretty good. And thirdly just go there and have a fucking drink!
