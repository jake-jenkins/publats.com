<p><strong>This bar has now closed down but has reopened with a new name and management. New review to come soon</strong></p>

<p>Sitting in the shadows of the popular and more established La Paca bar L’Arbre deserves more love and attention.</p>

<p>For starters it has a cool walled garden terrace, a rarity in these parts. Secondly, my mate Marc told me that the food is pretty good. And thirdly just go there and have a fucking drink!</p>
