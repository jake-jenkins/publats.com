Think plastic seats.

Think T.V. in the corner.

Think low prices.

Think grim toilets.

Think run by Chinese people.

This is the Shitty Spanish Bar Chinese Version 2.0 – a type of traditional [Shitty Spanish Bar](Shitty Spanish Bar) but run by Chinese people. Along with banks and pharmacies these bars are everywhere in Valencia (there are less in the city centre). If it’s not a Shitty Spanish Bar (See above list but remove Chinese people and replace with grumpy Spanish people) then it will likely be a Shitty Spanish Bar Chinese Version 2.0.
