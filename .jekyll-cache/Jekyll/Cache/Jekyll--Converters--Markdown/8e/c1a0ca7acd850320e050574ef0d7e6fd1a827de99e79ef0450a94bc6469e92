<p>Quite possibly the best named bar in Valencia and the second stop on the La Ruta de Baka-Grau, Euro 5 (as it will now be known) was pretty much how imagined it to be but better…. or worse. I can’t decide.</p>

<p>Basically it’s a Bolivian bar which always seems quite busy despite its unattractive appearance. It’s quite simple inside, think plastic seats… big TV in the corner…. plus Christmas decorations on the wall (in July – extra points for this).</p>

<p>Whilst there, we had a look at the menu which included photos that somehow made the dishes look inedible. That being said, as I’ve never eaten Bolivian food I’d like to go back to eat there one day.</p>

<p>Drinks prices were average (€1.5 for a normal sized bottle of beer) but they lose bonus points as they didn’t offer nuts.</p>
