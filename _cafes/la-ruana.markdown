La Ruana, or as it’s commonly known (by me at least) ‘The Columbian’ is a great little cafe/bar on Avenida Del Puerto.

In my opinion they serve some of the best tomato toast + coffee ‘breakfast specials’ in the area (between €2.20 – €2.70). They also have what looks like a decent lunch menu of Colombian![Ruana.jpg](/uploads/Ruana.jpg) food (arepas and other such shiz) which I haven’t tried but am 87% sure is nice.

It is quite cosy inside… they also have a sheltered terrace and on street seating. The staff are friendly and smiley. The only downside is the ceiling tiles…. why oh why have an office style false ceiling? I’m always disappointed when I look up so usually sip my coffee and stare at my big feet.

I recommend this place or in Spanglish yo recomendio!
