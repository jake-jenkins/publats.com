Many people seem to get a semi over La Pascuala (another local bar that specialises in stuffed baguettes/bocadillos). And I must admit that I was quite horny for 'La Pa' when I first moved to Valencia. I started to become less aroused when the owners moved from a charmingly chaotic, old bar just off the beach to the charmless (but with clean toilets and a terrace) site on Calle del Dr Lluch.

Now, La Pa isn't tooooo bad, the bocadillos are tasty enough, it's just that it is so fucking popular that it's hard to get a seat. Bodega J. Flor is equally as delicious, is pretty chilled and has way more charm. There are lots of meat and vegi options to stuff into your baguette and it is very reasonable price wise. For example 3 baguettes, 3 coffees and 3 freshly squeezed orange juices came to â‚¬20
