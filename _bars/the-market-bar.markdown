The Market Bar is a new, and welcome, addition to the Cabañal scene. It’s A kind of #fakenews British/Irish style bar (which I usually #detest).

This bar is far enough away from the city centre to avoid the twatty (“It’s just bants pal”) stag/hen parties and the ‘I’ve lived in Spain for 6 years but spend every weekend in St Pat’s, ain’t Spain great?/did you know you can buy baked beans in Consum?’ crowd. 

Despite making a bit of effort to avoid the ‘Brits Abroad’ cliché… sometimes the pull of a 6 nations rugby game is too strong to resist and the Market Bar helps satisfy my need to watch 15 blokes run into 15 other blokes for 80 minutes.

The Market Bar has a fairly decent/slightly boring selection of multinational beer brands, comfortable seats, fucking loads of TVs, quality shitters and attentive staff. The menu is a little uninspiring, however, they do sell Sunday Roast (which I am a little scared to try).

The one time that I did try the food, I ordered a jacket potato with cheese and chorizo (lightly sprinkled on top rather than stuffed to the max… disappointingly). The potato was expertly cooked… in the microwave (I think) but the most shocking thing, especially now that they are available in Consum, was that I couldn’t fill my potato with baked beans….. when will the Spaniards learn!?
