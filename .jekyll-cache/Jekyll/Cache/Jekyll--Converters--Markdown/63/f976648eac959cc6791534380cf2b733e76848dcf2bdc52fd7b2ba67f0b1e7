<p>If there is one thing Spain lacks (apart from safe drivers) itâ€™s coffee shops.</p>

<p>Ok, you can get decent, reasonably priced coffee in many of the out there but itâ€™s much nicer and cosier, in my opinion, to drink your coffee in a coffee shop.</p>

<p>Free from the throat clearing, carajillo sipping functioning alcoholics that you often find in your local bar, Pannes is a relatively relaxing place to pass the time (of course this is Spain, so bear in mind that there is still a TV in the corner and people shout at each other instead of talking).</p>

<p>The breakfast special of tomato toast and coffee for â‚¬2 is recommendedâ€¦.</p>
