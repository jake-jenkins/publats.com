<p>Los Faroles specialises in large bocadillos (baguettes filled with meat &amp; stuff).</p>

<p>I usually order a half size bocadillo (I would recommend that you do the same) but when I last went, with my football mates, we all ordered full sized, mega-super, bad ass bocadillos… never again! Ok, the quality is pretty good (La Pascuala and Bodega J. Flor are better) and the value for money is excellent but for me it’s too much food (my fault entirely). I felt full all day…in fact I still feel full just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Unless you have a large appetite be careful what you order…. Busy on weekends, but you can always takeaway and eat on the beach.</p>
