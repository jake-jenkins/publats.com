I"î<p>A mission created after a drunken conversation, the aim of this blog is to sample and review every bar in the Poblats Mar√≠tims district of Valencia which includes the neighbourhoods of El Grau, Caba√±al, Malvarrosa and Nazaret.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the aformentioned conversation I realised that it was almost certain the mission would fail due to the sheer number of bars. However, I thought fuck it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd try and do as many as possible.</p>

<p>Starting in Grau and Caba√±al‚Ä¶ (and probably never reaching Nazaret) the bars will be given a silly and largely pointless review then posted up on this blog and Instawank</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
