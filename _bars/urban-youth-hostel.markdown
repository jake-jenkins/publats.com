This place is situated in one of the more beautiful buildings on Port Avenue (Avenida del Puerto). The bar is connected to the Hostel and they have made more effort than most of the typical ‘shitty Spanish bars‘ in the area in terms of interior.

The coffee is excellent and the beers are a bit standard (Heineken/Amstel etc). The food is a mixture of Spanish dishes and fast food and seems reasonably priced….

The staff are really friendly, It has a large terrace on the street in front and the toilets are clean with plenty of loo roll… great for an emergency poo.
