A typical Spanish bar, the best thing about El Kapricho is its terrace, which is located off the main avenue thus slightly quieter than many terraces in the area. 

Oh, and their tinto de verano is excellent (better to ask for one without the added sugar though) and quite possibly the best in Grao.

Inside is hardly worth writing about… so I won’t.

It’s not a bar worth going out of your way for but if you’re close by and gagging for a cheeky drink it is worth it.
