<p>Stop number 5 on La Ruta de Baka-Grau is called El Ultramarinos and is a relatively new bar in El CabaÃ±al despite the fact that it looks old/traditional.</p>

<p>The food looked fish heavy (with a lot of tinned optionsâ€¦ Iâ€™m not sure why anyone would go to a bar and pay a premium to eat tinned fishâ€¦ but Iâ€™m Welsh so what do I know?) and quite expensive. The staff were friendly and attentive and the terrace (a new edition) was lively.</p>

<p>I think that this is more of a bar for eating than drinking and as we didnâ€™t fancy eating tinned fish itâ€™s difficult to give it an accurate review.</p>
