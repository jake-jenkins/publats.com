<p>Stop number 4 on La Ruta de Baka-Grau and arguably the best bar of the evening was Mala Fama (which means bad reputation).</p>

<p>I could go down the cheesy road here and say that Mala fama has anything but a bad reputation but I wonâ€™t because Iâ€™m not a local newspaper journalistâ€¦ or a twat.</p>

<p>Anywayâ€¦. this bar ticks all the boxes (maybe I am a twat):</p>

<p>Cool interior = tick
Tasty looking food = tick
Lively terrace = tick
Are you tired of reading bullet points = tick
The only negatives are that itâ€™s a bit too cool, the gender names on the toilet doors are in Valencianâ€¦. which always confuses me. Oh and my mate has a problem with the sinks in the toilets being shaped like tin buckets.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is a great addition to the area. Go there!</p>

<p>Apologies for the shite photoâ€¦ I aim to go back and retake it soon.</p>
