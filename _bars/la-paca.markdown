Probably my favourite bar and against which every other bar will be rated.

Cool inside – with a quirky interior.

Nice, little sun trapped terrace.

Very reasonably priced food and drink.

Ok…. the toilets are bit dodgy…. but most bar toilets in Spain are bit dodgy.

La Paca is also one of the few bars in Valencia that will give you a little tapa with every drink. Bonus points all round.
