I"¾<p><img src="/uploads/Dolce%20Milano.jpg" alt="Dolce Milano.jpg" />A few years back I went to Dolce Milano to try and buy some baguettes.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the evening and many shops had shut or run out of stuff and it was becoming a bit of a bread emergency (a bregency perhaps?). As I walked towards Dolce Milano I saw a basket of baguettes on a shelf above the counter and breathed a sigh of relief that my bread-based nightmare was about to come to an end. I walked in and asked the bandanna-wearing Italian owner if I could have a few baguettes and this is what followed:</p>

<p>Him: We donâ€™t have any bread.</p>

<p>Me: What about those up there?</p>

<p>Him: You canâ€™t have them.</p>

<p>Me: Why?</p>

<p>He reaches up and grabs a baguette and smashes the dry stick in half over the counter.</p>

<p>Him: Oh, you wanna dis bread do ya? You wanna dis bread?</p>

<p>Me: Hmmmm maybe notâ€¦â€¦â€¦</p>

<p>This incident aside Iâ€™d say that this is (normally) one of the best places in the area to buy bread, cakes, slices of pizza, other Italian food and it also sells excellent coffee. The crazy motherfucker behind the counter also adds to the charm. Eat in or take away â€“ Recommended.</p>
