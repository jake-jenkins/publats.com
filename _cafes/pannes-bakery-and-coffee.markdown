If there is one thing Spain lacks (apart from safe drivers) it’s coffee shops. 

Ok, you can get decent, reasonably priced coffee in many of the out there but it’s much nicer and cosier, in my opinion, to drink your coffee in a coffee shop.

Free from the throat clearing, carajillo sipping functioning alcoholics that you often find in your local bar, Pannes is a relatively relaxing place to pass the time (of course this is Spain, so bear in mind that there is still a TV in the corner and people shout at each other instead of talking).

The breakfast special of tomato toast and coffee for €2 is recommended….
